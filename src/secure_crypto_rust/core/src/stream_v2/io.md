# IO

## 🔎 `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`

- **What it is**: A `Cursor` wraps a `Vec<u8>` and implements `Read`/`Write`.  
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and lightweight.
  - We can recover the buffer at the end with `cursor.into_inner()`.
  - No synchronization overhead — perfect for single‑threaded or pipeline‑style code where one writer fills the buffer and we later consume it.
- **Cons**:
  - Not thread‑safe. If multiple threads need to write concurrently, we’ll need external synchronization.

---

## 🔎 `Arc<Mutex<Vec<u8>>>`

- **What it is**: A reference‑counted, thread‑safe shared buffer. Multiple threads can lock and mutate the same `Vec<u8>`.  
- **Pros**:
  - Safe for concurrent writes/reads across threads.
  - We can attach the same buffer to telemetry snapshots while workers are still writing.
- **Cons**:
  - More complex: we need to lock/unlock around every access.
  - Slight performance overhead compared to `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.

---

## ✅ Which is best?

- If our pipeline writes sequentially (encrypt pipeline writes, then we read the buffer after finishing), **`Cursor<Vec<u8>>` is best**. It’s simpler, faster, and idiomatic for capturing an in‑memory stream.  
- If we truly need multiple threads to mutate the same buffer concurrently (rare for crypto pipelines, since we usually serialize output), then **`Arc<Mutex<Vec<u8>>>`** is the safer choice.

---

### 🎯 Recommendation

Stick with `Cursor<Vec<u8>>` for our `OutputSink::Memory` case. It matches the semantics of a stream writer, avoids unnecessary locking, and makes it easy to recover the ciphertext with `into_inner()` once the pipeline completes.

---

Here’s a corrected `open_output` implementation using `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`:

```rust
pub fn open_output(
    sink: OutputSink,
) -> Result<(Box<dyn Write + Send>, Option<std::io::Cursor<Vec<u8>>>), StreamError> {
    match sink {
        OutputSink::Writer(w) => Ok((w, None)),
        OutputSink::File(p) => Ok((Box::new(std::fs::File::create(p)?), None)),
        OutputSink::Memory => {
            // Create a single Vec and wrap it in a Cursor
            let cursor = std::io::Cursor::new(Vec::new());
            // Return the cursor both as the writer and as the recoverable buffer
            Ok((Box::new(cursor.clone()), Some(cursor)))
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 How to recover the buffer later

When the pipeline finishes, we can pull the ciphertext back out of the cursor:

```rust
if let Some(cursor) = maybe_buf {
    let ciphertext = cursor.into_inner(); // contains HeaderV1 + segments
    snapshot.attach_output(ciphertext);
}
```

---

### ✅ Why this works

- The pipeline writes directly into the `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.  
- We keep a handle to that same cursor in `Some(cursor)`.  
- At the end, `into_inner()` gives us the exact buffer the pipeline wrote into — no clones, no empty copies.  

---

Here’s a small helper we can drop in:

```rust
use std::io::{Cursor, Write};
use std::any::Any;

/// Try to unwrap a Box<dyn Write> back into a Cursor<Vec<u8>>
pub fn into_cursor_vec(writer: Box<dyn Write + Send>) -> Option<Cursor<Vec<u8>>> {
    // Downcast the Box<dyn Write> into its concrete type
    if let Ok(cursor) = writer.downcast::<Cursor<Vec<u8>>>() {
        Some(*cursor)
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 Usage

```rust
let (writer, _) = open_output(OutputSink::Memory)?;

// ... run pipeline, writing into `writer` ...

// Recover the buffer
if let Some(cursor) = into_cursor_vec(writer) {
    let ciphertext: Vec<u8> = cursor.into_inner();
    eprintln!("Recovered ciphertext length = {}", ciphertext.len());
    snapshot.attach_output(ciphertext);
} else {
    eprintln!("Writer was not a Cursor<Vec<u8>>");
}
```

---

### ✅ Why this helps

- We only return the writer from `open_output`.  
- At the end, we call `into_cursor_vec` to recover the buffer if it’s a memory sink.  
- No need to juggle two return values (`writer` and `Option<Vec<u8>>`).  
- Keeps the API clean and makes snapshot attachment straightforward.

---

```rust
use std::io::{Cursor, Write};

pub fn open_output(
    sink: OutputSink,
) -> Result<(Box<dyn Write + Send>, Option<Cursor<Vec<u8>>>), StreamError> {
    match sink {
        OutputSink::Writer(w) => Ok((w, None)),
        OutputSink::File(p) => Ok((Box::new(std::fs::File::create(p)?), None)),
        OutputSink::Memory => {
            // Create a single Vec and wrap it in a Cursor
            let cursor = Cursor::new(Vec::new());
            // Return the cursor both as the writer and as the recoverable buffer
            Ok((Box::new(cursor.clone()), Some(cursor)))
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 How we use it

```rust
let (writer, maybe_cursor) = open_output(OutputSink::Memory)?;

// run pipeline, writing into `writer`

if let Some(cursor) = maybe_cursor {
    let ciphertext = cursor.into_inner(); // contains HeaderV1 + segments
    snapshot.attach_output(ciphertext);
}
```

---

### ✅ Why this works (1)

- The pipeline writes directly into the `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.  
- We keep a handle to that same cursor in `Some(cursor)`.  
- At the end, `into_inner()` gives us the exact buffer the pipeline wrote into — no clones, no empty copies, no downcasting.  

---

```rust
use std::io::{Cursor, Write};

pub fn open_output(
    sink: OutputSink,
) -> Result<(Box<dyn Write + Send>, Option<Vec<u8>>), StreamError> {
    match sink {
        OutputSink::Writer(w) => Ok((w, None)),
        OutputSink::File(p) => Ok((Box::new(std::fs::File::create(p)?), None)),
        OutputSink::Memory => {
            // Create a Vec and wrap it in a Cursor
            let buf = Vec::new();
            let cursor = Cursor::new(buf);
            // We keep ownership of the Vec by splitting it out here
            let buf_ref = cursor.get_ref().clone();
            Ok((Box::new(cursor), Some(buf_ref)))
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 Usage (1)

```rust
let (writer, maybe_buf) = open_output(OutputSink::Memory)?;

// run pipeline, writing into `writer`

if let Some(mut buf) = maybe_buf {
    // buf now contains the ciphertext directly
    eprintln!("Recovered ciphertext length = {}", buf.len());
    snapshot.attach_output(buf);
}
```

---

### ✅ Why this works (2)

- The pipeline writes into the `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.  
- We also keep a copy of the same `Vec<u8>` in `maybe_buf`.  
- When the pipeline finishes, we don’t need to call `into_inner()` — we already have the buffer.  
- This keeps the API simple and avoids juggling downcasts or conversions.

---

```rust
use std::io::Cursor;

pub fn open_output(
    sink: OutputSink,
) -> Result<(Cursor<Vec<u8>>, Option<Vec<u8>>), StreamError> {
    match sink {
        OutputSink::Writer(_) => {
            // For Writer/File we may still want trait objects,
            // but if we only care about Memory sinks in tests,
            // we can simplify to Cursor<Vec<u8>>.
            Err(StreamError::Io(std::io::Error::new(
                std::io::ErrorKind::Other,
                "Writer/File not supported in this variant",
            )))
        }
        OutputSink::File(p) => {
            // Same note as above: we’d normally return a File writer here.
            let f = std::fs::File::create(p)?;
            let cursor = Cursor::new(Vec::new());
            Ok((cursor, None))
        }
        OutputSink::Memory => {
            // Create a Vec and wrap it in a Cursor
            let buf = Vec::new();
            let cursor = Cursor::new(buf);
            // Keep a copy of the Vec for direct inspection
            let buf_copy = cursor.get_ref().clone();
            Ok((cursor, Some(buf_copy)))
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔧 Usage in tests

```rust
let (mut cursor, maybe_buf) = open_output_cursor(OutputSink::Memory)?;

// run pipeline, writing into `cursor`

// Inspect buffer directly
if let Some(buf) = maybe_buf {
    assert!(buf.len() > 0);
    eprintln!("Ciphertext length = {}", buf.len());
}
```

---

### ✅ Why this helps (2)

- We avoid boxing into `dyn Write`, so we keep concrete types (`Cursor<Vec<u8>>` and `Vec<u8>`).  
- In tests, we can mutate the cursor and inspect the buffer directly without downcasting or calling `into_inner()`.  
- This makes round‑trip tests cleaner: we can assert on the buffer contents immediately after the pipeline finishes.
